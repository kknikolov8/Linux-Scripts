# Linux Scripting Repository

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of Linux shell scripts that demonstrate my knowledge and proficiency in Bash scripting. The scripts showcase the use of:
- **Conditional statements** (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- **Exit codes** (`exit 0`, `exit 1`, etc.)
- **For loops** (`for var in list; do ... done`)
- **While loops** (`while condition; do ... done`)

## Purpose
The scripts included in this repository serve as a practical demonstration of my skills in Linux scripting and automation. They cover various scenarios, such as:
- Handling user input and validating arguments
- Controlling script execution flow using exit codes
- Iterating over files, directories, and user-provided data

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kknikolov8/Linux-Scripts.git
   cd Linux-Scripts
   ```
2. Grant execution permissions to a script:
   ```bash
   chmod +x script_name.sh
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   ./script_name.sh
   ```

## Prerequisites
- A Linux-based system with **Bash** installed
- Basic familiarity with the terminal and command-line execution
